The cog rattle evolved as a warning signal - designed to alert those nearby of approaching danger - in Europe during the Middle Ages (the period between about A.D. 400 and 1400).

And this is a place to share my writings from a variety of mediums. 

I am hoping to reinstantiate an ongoing writing practice that has been lifelong, but that paused in a puddle after I finished my PhD. I very much write in the traditions of my supervisors, from Erin Manning, Denise Ferreira da Silva, and Stefano Harney. This means base faith in process philosophy, the "Black radical tradition" as a contested and constantly escaping and never disappearing thing, and autonomous political theory about infrastructure and (non)change management, all in the context of being constantly surrounded by evasions of encounter with collapse.

I also write poetry. I also write popular analysis of music and culture. I love both these things. I also write to contend with my trauma from my history growing up in the charismatic church, and so delve devilishly from time to time not into critique but rather into some kind of ethnography of the parts that still touch me, move me, and track with my life-saving study of the last 10 years.

I am fairly anti careerist in any academic or political sense, and am interested in the popularization of philosophy not as artifact but as practices continually finding us where we are (see the perverse take on theological language and concepts already--it is baked in and so let's use it so that, if it can't help, it at least is acknowledged as one pathos in the room).
