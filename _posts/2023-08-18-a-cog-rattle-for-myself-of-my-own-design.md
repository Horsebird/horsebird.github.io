## a cog rattle: for me, for you, in the interest of non-panic and non-denial

Hello, is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?

"Comfortably Numb" by Pink Floyd


I was going to be an economic designer, I was going to be a philosopher, I was going to be a singer, I was going to the other side, and the other, and the other. Lately, for the last few years, the sense of panic and non-panic course through my veins. Easy reference: fight or flight response to everything, limbic to the core, to the edges of my skin.

Is this my book? Is this my body, broken for me? I am rusty but still good. Whether anyone cares is another question.
