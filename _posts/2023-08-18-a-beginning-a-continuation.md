## A Beginning, a Continuation

So here I am, in the wrap of a blog. Do I introduce myself and thus accept or implore an audience? Do I try to make a professional tone or a tone that doesn't care, or one that appears naturally technical, or one naturally frivilous or disclosive?

I am here to make sure I don't stop writing. Because I have written since I was 12 or so, and that was almost 30 years ago. But I did a PhD, and it was the classical cake in the mouth/worm in the mouth situation. I had to spit it out but I could not stop eating. I love what I wrote and what I wrote about, and I want to keep talking about those things here. In this way, I was lucky in my PhD. Many leave their subjects all together because of a traumatic experience with their supervisor. I was incredibly fortunate; my experience was the opposite in this regard, a dream even. But this didn't stop me from losing writing somewhere along the way.

I also got divorced and moved away from my community in Montreal in order to remain close to my son.  As a songwriter, the songs kept flowing. But the writing stopped. The theoretical, the poetic, it dried up. Not out of lack of thought or feeling, but because of...I don't know. Depression? Relief at having finished the PhD? Stress of large style life moves, mountains of life moving, and me moving with them.

The other piece of information that is important to me about this story is my work life, its eros, failure, continuous mental provocation.
